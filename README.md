## Compatibility

The script supports these Linux distributions:

|                    | Support |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| AlmaLinux 8        | âœ…      |
| Amazon Linux 2     | âœ…      |
| Arch Linux         | âœ…      |
| CentOS 7           | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |
| CentOS Stream >= 8 | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |
| Debian >= 10       | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |
| Fedora >= 35       | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |
| Oracle Linux 8     | âœ…      |
| Rocky Linux 8      | âœ…      |
| Ubuntu >= 22.04    | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |

To be noted:

- The script is regularly tested against the distributions marked with a ðŸ¤– only.
  - It's only tested on `amd64` architecture.
- It should work on older versions such as Debian 8+, Ubuntu 16.04+ and previous Fedora releases. But versions not in the table above are not officially supported.
  - It should also support versions between the LTS versions, but these are not tested.
- The script requires `systemd`.

## Fork



Since 2016, the two scripts have diverged and are not alike anymore, especially under the hood. The main goal of the script was enhanced security. But since then, the script has been completely rewritten and a lot a features have been added. The script is only compatible with recent distributions though, so if you need to use a very old server or client, I advise using Nyr's script.

## Security and Encryption

> **Warning**
> This has not been updated for OpenVPN 2.5 and later.

OpenVPN's default settings are pretty weak regarding encryption. This script aims to improve that.

OpenVPN 2.4 was a great update regarding encryption. It added support for ECDSA, ECDH, AES GCM, NCP and tls-crypt.

If you want more information about an option mentioned below, head to the [OpenVPN manual](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn24ManPage). It is very complete.

Most of OpenVPN's encryption-related stuff is managed by [Easy-RSA](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa). Defaults parameters are in the [vars.example](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/blob/v3.0.7/easyrsa3/vars.example) file.

### Compression

By default, OpenVPN doesn't enable compression. This script provides support for LZ0 and LZ4 (v1/v2) algorithms, the latter being more efficient.

However, it is discouraged to use compression since the [VORACLE attack](https://protonvpn.com/blog/voracle-attack/) makes use of it.

### TLS version

OpenVPN accepts TLS 1.0 by default, which is nearly [20 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_1.0).

With `tls-version-min 1.2` we enforce TLS 1.2, which the best protocol available currently for OpenVPN.

TLS 1.2 is supported since OpenVPN 2.3.3.
